        Annotate the peak intensity table (such as outputted from apLCMS) with metabolites from the metabolite database using advanced methods.

        The annotation process generates all possible metabolite-adduct pairs from the metabolite and adduct databases and matches those pairs to the measured peaks.
        A metabolite-adduct pair is pronounced as a match to the peak when the difference of their masses are withing some tolerance.
        Then a score and a confidence level is assigned to each match based on peak correlation clustering, metabolite pathway associations, adducts expectations, and isotope conformations.
